## Project Description

This project is a multilingual website with support for both Persian and English languages. It utilizes multiple data sources, including MongoDB and SQL Server databases. The design patterns used in this project are Singleton and Unit of Work.

### Features
- Multilingual Support: The website supports both Persian and English languages, allowing users to switch between languages seamlessly.
- Discount Code Functionality: The website includes a discount code feature where users can apply a discount code to their shopping cart and receive a discounted price.
- Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart and view the total price of the items.
- Singleton Design Pattern: The Singleton design pattern is used to ensure that only one instance of certain classes, such as database connections or configuration settings, is created throughout the application.
- Unit of Work Design Pattern: The Unit of Work design pattern is implemented to manage database transactions and ensure that a consistent state is maintained when working with multiple data sources.

### Technologies Used
- Front-End: HTML, CSS,BootStrap JavaScript Ajax
- Back-End: ASP.NET
- Database: MongoDB, SQL Server
- Design Patterns: Singleton, Unit of Work

### Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the required dependencies and ensure that all necessary packages are installed.
3. Configure the connection strings for MongoDB and SQL Server databases in the project's configuration files.
4. Build and run the project.

### Usage
- Users can access the website through a web browser and navigate through different pages, switch between Persian and English languages, and add products to their shopping cart.
- To apply a discount code, users can enter the code in the designated field and click the "Apply" button. The website will validate the code and display the updated total price.
- Developers can refer to the codebase to understand the implementation of multilingual support, discount code functionality, and the usage of Singleton and Unit of Work design patterns.
- The project can be extended and customized according to specific requirements.

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with additional data sources or APIs to enhance the product catalog or provide more features.
- Improved user interface and user experience design.
- Implementation of user authentication and authorization.
- Performance optimization and caching mechanisms.
- Testing and quality assurance to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
